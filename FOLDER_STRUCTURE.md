### Directory Descriptions

- **`src/`**: The root directory for the source code of the application.

- **`app/`**: Contains the main application logic and entry points, including routing configurations and the main application component.

- **`components/`**: Houses shared, reusable UI components that can be used across different parts of the application.

- **`config/`**: Contains configuration files for the application, such as environment variables and API endpoints.

- **`db/`**: Includes database-related files, such as models, migrations, or database connection utilities.

- **`admin/`** (optional): Contains admin panel functionalities, organized into subdirectories for different admin features like `users`, `projects`, `tasks`, and `settings`. Each feature has `ui` for user interfaces and `api` for backend logic.

- **`features/`** (required): A modular approach to organizing code by feature. Each feature directory includes:
  - `ui/`: User interface components specific to the feature.
  - `api/`: API logic specific to the feature.
  - `components/`: Reusable components specific to the feature.
  - `lib/`: Utility functions or libraries specific to the feature.
  - `hooks/`: Custom React hooks specific to the feature.

- **`hooks/`**: Contains custom React hooks that are used across multiple features or components.

- **`i18n/`**: Contains internationalization files for supporting multiple languages in the application.

- **`lib/`**: A directory for utility functions and libraries used across the entire application.

- **`middleware.ts`**: A TypeScript file for middleware logic, such as request handling and authentication.

This structure is designed to promote scalability, maintainability, and ease of navigation within the project. Each directory serves a specific purpose, making it easier for developers to find and manage code related to different aspects of the application.
